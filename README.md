# Anti-Scam Bot Link List
This is a list of links I collect for my bot. If you want to submit one, feel free to open a issue [here](https://github.com/2Lost4This/Anti-Scam-Bot-Link-List/labels/issues/new)
I will then check them, and then add them to the list, and then add them to the bot
## Examples 
I also show a small snippet of my code so you can see how the report should look best
