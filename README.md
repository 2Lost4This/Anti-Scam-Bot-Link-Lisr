# Anti-Scam Link List
This is a list of links I collect for my bot. If you want to submit one, feel free to open a issue [here](https://github.com/AntiScamBot/Anti-Scam-Link-List/issues/new)
I will then check them, and then add them to the list, and then add them to the bot

# Support
If you have any questions, feel free to open a discussion [here](https://github.com/AntiScamBot/Anti-Scam-Link-List/discussions/new). 
I will try to help as soon as possible. Also you can [join my server](https://discord.gg/4Q87pfTWqC) to ask questions, also i will probably make a public log (with webhooks) where i will mark solved pull requests
